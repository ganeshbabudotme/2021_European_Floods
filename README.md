The maps and related content took me 6 hours to make. To process the data, read about the floods and make the maps. Used QGIS for the maps and Photoshop for the non-map slides.

It was also super interesting to see that that the Copernicus Emergency Mapping Service provides a centralised, on-demand detailed information based on satellite imagery for selected emergency situations that arise from natural or man-made disasters. This information is then made available for free for others to build on. A similar system for Indian cities might be crucial going forward, with urban flooding around heavy rains becoming more or less the norm in major Indian cities.
